# Operators
# +, -, *, / (float division)
# int division
# % (modulo): 'mod' remainder
# ** power

print(10 / 2)  # 5.0
print(10 // 3)  # 3
print(10 % 3)  # 1
print(10 ** 3)  # 1000

# = : assignment operator
number = 7
number = number + 3  # increments number by 3

# += : increment operator
number += 2
print("number =  ", number)

# *= : multiply by
number *= 2
print("number =", number)

# /=, //= divide by
number //= 2
print("number = ", number)

# Boolean Operators
# Boolean (bool) is a type of value that can only be True or False

# 1.Comparison
# == : equality (equal)
print(3 == 4)
# != : not equal to
print(3 != 4)

# > : greater than
# < : less than
# >= : greater than or equal to
# <= : less than or equal to
print(3 > 4)
print(3 <= 3)

# This is 'chained comparison'
# Check (3 < x) and (x < 5) at the same time

x = 1
print(3 < x < 5)

# A or B : either A or B has to be True, to return True
# A and B : both A and B have to be True, to return True
print((3 < x) or (x < 5))
print((3 < x) and (x < 5))


# Exercise
num = 10
# print((num > 1) or (num / 0 == 0))
# print((num > 1) and (num / 0 == 0)) in Python 0 cannot be divided
# print((num <= 10) and (num / 0 == 0))
# print(num <= 10)
print(not True)  # False
print(not False)  # True
